CCI xG Acceptable Use Policy
=======================================

Introduction
------------

The CCI xG Testbed Internal User Policy outlines the guidelines and requirements for individuals associated with the CCI Hub who wish to access and utilize the CCI xG Testbed resources. This policy is an addition to the current CCI xG Testbed acceptable use policy (AUP) and must be adhered to by all internal users.

User Definitions
----------------

Internal Users
--------------

Individuals who are associated with CCI Hub (such as research faculty, A/P faculty, tenured faculty, postdoc researchers, Ph.D. and MS students, staff) and are physically located at the CCI Hub facility in Arlington, VA.

External Users
--------------

Any individual that does not fit the Internal Users definition.

Internal User Policies
-----------------------

1. **Resource Use Approval**
   - The use of the CCI xG Testbed resources must be vetted by the CCI xG Testbed Director. This can be done by:
     - Scheduling a meeting to discuss the use of the resource, period, and requirements; and/or
     - Providing clear documentation and description of the project.

2. **Collaborations and Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**
   - Collaborations with an external partner institution/organization may or may not require an NDA in place.
     - An NDA will be needed if the collaboration with the external partner requires access to the CCI xG Testbed software design architecture coding (that is not publicly available yet) for additional implementation by the external party.

3. **External Personnel Hosting**
   - Whenever the CCI xG Testbed hosts external personnel (i.e., students, postdocs, or researchers not associated with the CCI Hub), a statement of work that clearly describes the work that will be conducted and the expected results need to be in place before the work starts.

4. **CCI xG Testbed Support Team Responsibilities**
   - Unless personnel time is budgeted as part of the project plan, with approval by the CCI xG Testbed Director, the CCI xG Testbed support team is not responsible for executing any related project tasks using the CCI xG Testbed resources.
   - The CCI xG Testbed support team is responsible for resource operation and remote access availability of resources to users.
     - Any request beyond the standard support must be vetted by the CCI xG Testbed Director and may be subject to budgetary constraints (and/or joint/collaboration work).

5. **Resource Tracking**
   - Internal users must keep track of the resources they use and access using an agreed-upon equipment tracking method (mainly applicable to Ph.D., MS, and Postdoc Researchers).

6. **Additional Hardware or Software Resources**
   - Any hardware or software resource that may be required for a project but is not available in the CCI xG Testbed can be added or integrated if the PI has funds to acquire the resource.
     - The resource will need to be vetted before being deployed at the testbed.
     - The PI may be required to provide engineering support for the integration or deployment of the resource.
       - A system design and integration plan may be required.

7. **Visitor Notification**
   - Any visitors to the CCI xG Testbed must be notified in advance as follows:
     - Please send an email to cci.xg.testbed.admin@cyberinitiative.org highlighting the following: visitor names and affiliations, date and time, goals for the visit, resources required, and duration of the visit.
     - A notification will be sent back to confirm the visit or request further information.

8. **Proposal Responsibilities**
   - When adding the CCI xG Testbed to a proposal, it is the PI's responsibility:
     - To budget the necessary resources (hardware, software, and personnel) to produce the deliverables and milestones described in the proposal.
     - To communicate to the CCI xG Testbed Director the testbed availability and functionalities needed during the project lifetime as described in the proposal.

9. **Resource Movement**
   - None of the CCI xG Testbed resources can be moved outside the CCI Hub facilities (VT-RC 3rd Floor) without notification and a property agreement in place.

10. **Acknowledgment and Citation**
    - Any work derived from the CCI xG Testbed must acknowledge and cite "CCI xG Testbed".
