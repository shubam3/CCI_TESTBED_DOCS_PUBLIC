CCI xG Testbed User Policy
==========================

Introduction
-----------

The Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI) xG Testbed User Policy outlines the guidelines, requirements, and responsibilities for individuals and organizations who wish to access and utilize the CCI xG Testbed resources. This policy is designed to ensure the proper use, maintenance, and security of the testbed infrastructure while facilitating innovative research and experimentation in next-generation wireless communications.

The CCI xG Testbed is a research and experimentation platform that embraces open-source ideology to enable real-world testing across indoor and outdoor scenarios for next generation (NextG) wireless communications systems. As a valuable shared resource, all users must adhere to these policies to maintain the integrity, security, and availability of the testbed for the entire research community.

User Classifications
-------------------

The CCI xG Testbed distinguishes between different types of users based on their affiliation and physical location:

Internal Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Individuals who are associated with CCI Hub (such as research faculty, A/P faculty, tenured faculty, postdoc researchers, Ph.D. and MS students, staff) and are physically located at the CCI Hub facility in Arlington, VA.

External Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any individual that does not fit the Internal Users definition.

Resource Usage Policies
----------------------

Resource Use Approval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The use of the CCI xG Testbed resources must be vetted by the CCI xG Testbed Director. This approval process can be completed through one of the following methods:

* Scheduling a meeting to discuss the use of the resource, period, and requirements
* Providing clear documentation and description of the project

Collaborations and Non-Disclosure Agreements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collaborations with external partner institutions or organizations may require specific agreements:

* Collaborations may or may not require a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) in place
* An NDA will be needed if the collaboration with the external partner requires access to the CCI xG Testbed software design architecture coding (that is not publicly available yet) for additional implementation by the external party

External Personnel Hosting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the CCI xG Testbed hosts external personnel (i.e., students, postdocs, or researchers not associated with the CCI Hub):

* A statement of work that clearly describes the work that will be conducted and the expected results must be in place before the work starts
* The statement should outline the scope, timeline, and deliverables of the work to be performed

Support and Responsibilities
---------------------------

CCI xG Testbed Support Team Responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CCI xG Testbed support team has specific responsibilities and limitations:

* Unless personnel time is budgeted as part of the project plan, with approval by the CCI xG Testbed Director, the CCI xG Testbed support team is not responsible for executing any related project tasks using the CCI xG Testbed resources
* The CCI xG Testbed support team is responsible for resource operation and remote access availability of resources to users
* Any request beyond the standard support must be vetted by the CCI xG Testbed Director and may be subject to budgetary constraints (and/or joint/collaboration work)

Resource Management
------------------

Resource Tracking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users must maintain accountability for the resources they utilize:

* Internal users must keep track of the resources they use and access using an agreed-upon equipment tracking method (mainly applicable to Ph.D., MS, and Postdoc Researchers)
* This tracking helps ensure efficient allocation and management of testbed resources

Additional Hardware or Software Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For projects requiring resources not currently available in the CCI xG Testbed:

* Any hardware or software resource that may be required for a project but is not available in the CCI xG Testbed can be added or integrated if the PI has funds to acquire the resource
* The resource will need to be vetted before being deployed at the testbed
* The PI may be required to provide engineering support for the integration or deployment of the resource
* A system design and integration plan may be required

Resource Movement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To maintain the integrity and security of the testbed:

* None of the CCI xG Testbed resources can be moved outside the CCI Hub facilities (VT-RC 3rd Floor) without notification and a property agreement in place
* This ensures proper tracking and protection of valuable testbed equipment

Administrative Procedures
------------------------

Visitor Notification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For security and planning purposes, visitors to the CCI xG Testbed must be pre-approved:

* Any visitors to the CCI xG Testbed must be notified in advance as follows:
  * Please send an email to cci.xg.testbed.admin@cyberinitiative.org highlighting the following: visitor names and affiliations, date and time, goals for the visit, resources required, and duration of the visit
  * A notification will be sent back to confirm the visit or request further information

Proposal Responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When including the CCI xG Testbed in research proposals:

* When adding the CCI xG Testbed to a proposal, it is the PI's responsibility:
  * To budget the necessary resources (hardware, software, and personnel) to produce the deliverables and milestones described in the proposal
  * To communicate to the CCI xG Testbed Director the testbed availability and functionalities needed during the project lifetime as described in the proposal

Acknowledgment and Citation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To properly recognize the contribution of the testbed to research outcomes:

* Any work derived from the CCI xG Testbed must acknowledge and cite "CCI xG Testbed". For citation guidelines, please refer to the :doc:`ccixg_citation` page.
