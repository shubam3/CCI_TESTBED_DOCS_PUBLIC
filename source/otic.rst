What is OTIC?
===============
The North American OTIC in the Washington DC/Arlington VA Metro is aimed at facilitating the design, development, and deployment of cloud-enhanced and open-software-defined wireless technologies. It provides multiple testbeds to support real-world experimentation, testing, and interoperability on advanced wireless technologies and applications for the next generation. The facility is open to a wide range of usersâ€”including universities, industry research labs, and both US and non-US institutions. Commercial entities are also encouraged to use the facility for product development and evaluation with certain provisions. Researchers can run experiments remotely on the testbed by logging in via a remote terminal (VPN and SSH), which provides various facilities for experiment execution, measurements, and data collection across the available testbeds.

OTIC Vision
===========
Serve as a center of excellence for R&D and innovation in O-RAN in the Washington DC metro area. OTIC is designed to support US government use cases, advance workforce development, and accelerate end-to-end O-RAN deployment and testing by providing state-of-the-art testbeds and remote access facilities. It brings together academia, industry, and government to ensure seamless integration and interoperability of open radio access network solutions, fostering practical innovation and progress in next-generation wireless communications.

Key Features of O-RAN OTIC at DC
=================================
Unique features include:

- **Hybrid Lab Infrastructure:** Combines indoor and outdoor testbeds to enable diverse experimental scenarios.
- **Advanced Remote Access:** Provides secure VPN and SSH access for remote experimentation.
- **Edge-Cloud Integration:** Supports real-time data processing and analytics through integrated edge and core cloud computing.

Testing and Evaluation Objective
===============================

The end-to-end testing process ensures that each Device Under Test (DUT) is evaluated thoroughly, reliably, and in alignment with industry standards as defined by the O-RAN Alliance. The workflow begins with a clear understanding of customer requirements and progresses through scoped planning, integration, systematic test execution, and result validation. Each step is designed to ensure a seamless and transparent experience from test request to final report delivering actionable insights and high-confidence outcomes.

The following steps describe how the workflow in the above image operates:

1. **Test Request**: Initial input from the customer outlining testing needs.


   - DUT Type(s): Specify the type(s) of Device Under Test.
   - Test Type(s): Indicate the nature of tests required (e.g., performance, conformance).
   - Supported Features: Indicate capabilities of the DUT.

2. **Test Scope**: Defines the framework and terms of the testing.

   - Applicable Tests: Identify test cases relevant to the DUT and its features.
   - NDA & Compliance: Confirm legal agreements and regulatory requirements.
   - Agreement: Finalize scope, deliverables, and responsibilities.

   <br>
3. **Pre-test Integration**: Preparation phase ensuring DUT readiness for testing.

   - DUT(s) Delivery: Receive the DUTs and verify their condition.
   - Integration: Connect and configure DUTs within the test environment.
   - Sanity Checks: Run basic checks to ensure DUTs are operational.

.. raw:: html
   <br>
4. **Testing**: Execution of planned tests.

   - Testing Schedule: Plan and organize the timeline for test execution.
   - Run Tests: Perform all agreed tests per defined scope and procedure.

.. raw:: html
   <br>
5. **Validation**: Assess results and report outcomes.

   - Test Reports: Document test results, logs, and performance metrics.
   - Identify Failures: Document errors and issues.
