What is OTIC?
===============
The North American OTIC in the Washington DC/Arlington VA Metro is aimed at facilitating the design, development, and deployment of cloud-enhanced and open-software-defined wireless technologies. It provides multiple testbeds to support real-world experimentation, testing, and interoperability on advanced wireless technologies and applications for the next generation. The facility is open to a wide range of users—including universities, industry research labs, and both US and non-US institutions. Commercial entities are also encouraged to use the facility for product development and evaluation with certain provisions. Researchers can run experiments remotely on the testbed by logging in via a remote terminal (VPN and SSH), which provides various facilities for experiment execution, measurements, and data collection across the available testbeds.

Testing and Evaluation Objective
===============================

The end-to-end testing process ensures that each Device Under Test (DUT) is evaluated thoroughly, reliably, and in alignment with industry standards as defined by the O-RAN Alliance. The workflow begins with a clear understanding of customer requirements and progresses through scoped planning, integration, systematic test execution, and result validation. Each step is designed to ensure a seamless and transparent experience from test request to final report delivering actionable insights and high-confidence outcomes.

The following steps describe how the workflow in the above image operates:

1. **Test Request**: Initial input from the customer outlining testing needs.


   - DUT Type(s): Specify the type(s) of Device Under Test.
   - Test Type(s): Indicate the nature of tests required (e.g., performance, conformance).
   - Supported Features: Indicate capabilities of the DUT.

2. **Test Scope**: Defines the framework and terms of the testing.

   - Applicable Tests: Identify test cases relevant to the DUT and its features.
   - NDA & Compliance: Confirm legal agreements and regulatory requirements.
   - Agreement: Finalize scope, deliverables, and responsibilities.

   <br>
3. **Pre-test Integration**: Preparation phase ensuring DUT readiness for testing.

   - DUT(s) Delivery: Receive the DUTs and verify their condition.
   - Integration: Connect and configure DUTs within the test environment.
   - Sanity Checks: Run basic checks to ensure DUTs are operational.

.. raw:: html
   <br>
4. **Testing**: Execution of planned tests.

   - Testing Schedule: Plan and organize the timeline for test execution.
   - Run Tests: Perform all agreed tests per defined scope and procedure.

.. raw:: html
   <br>
5. **Validation**: Assess results and report outcomes.

   - Test Reports: Document test results, logs, and performance metrics.
   - Identify Failures: Document errors and issues.
