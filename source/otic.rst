What is OTIC?
===============
The North American OTIC in the Washington DC/Arlington VA Metro is aimed at facilitating the design, development, and deployment of cloud-enhanced and open-software-defined wireless technologies. It provides multiple testbeds to support real-world experimentation, testing, and interoperability on advanced wireless technologies and applications for the next generation. The facility is open to a wide range of usersâ€”including universities, industry research labs, and both US and non-US institutions. Commercial entities are also encouraged to use the facility for product development and evaluation with certain provisions. Researchers can run experiments remotely on the testbed by logging in via a remote terminal (VPN and SSH), which provides various facilities for experiment execution, measurements, and data collection across the available testbeds.
