Radio Access Technology (RAT)
=====================================

srsRAN 
----------
srsRAN is an open-source software radio implementation that provides complete 4G and 5G cellular network functionality. It offers a flexible and customizable platform for research, development, and testing of wireless communication systems, supporting both UE (User Equipment) and base station implementations.

OAI
--------
OpenAirInterface (OAI) is a comprehensive open-source platform that implements 4G LTE and 5G NR radio access and core network protocols. It enables researchers and developers to create and experiment with end-to-end mobile network solutions, supporting various deployment scenarios from small-scale testbeds to production-ready implementations.

mmWave
--------
Millimeter Wave (mmWave) technology operates in frequency bands from 24 GHz to 100 GHz, providing significantly higher bandwidth and data rates for 5G networks. This technology enables ultra-high-speed wireless communications with reduced latency, though it faces challenges with signal propagation, requiring dense network deployments and advanced beamforming techniques to overcome limited range and penetration capabilities.
